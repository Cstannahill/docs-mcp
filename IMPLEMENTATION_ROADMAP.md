# MCP Enhancement Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Based on the successful demonstration of proposed features, here's a prioritized roadmap for implementing the enhanced MCP functionality with Ollama models and GitHub Copilot integration.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Priority: HIGH

**Goal**: Establish core infrastructure for advanced AI integration

### 1.1 Enhanced Ollama Client (`src/ollama_client.rs`)

```rust
pub struct EnhancedOllamaClient {
    base_client: ollama_rs::Ollama,
    model_registry: ModelRegistry,
    response_cache: Arc<Mutex<LruCache<String, CachedResponse>>>,
}

impl EnhancedOllamaClient {
    pub async fn query_with_context(&self, query: &str, context: &CodeContext) -> Result<String>;
    pub async fn multi_model_query(&self, query: &str, models: Vec<String>) -> Result<FusedResponse>;
    pub async fn get_optimal_model(&self, query_type: QueryType) -> String;
}
```

### 1.2 Code Context Analysis (`src/code_analyzer.rs`)

```rust
pub struct CodeAnalyzer {
    parsers: HashMap<String, TreeSitterParser>,
    lsp_clients: HashMap<String, LspClient>,
}

impl CodeAnalyzer {
    pub async fn analyze_file(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<CodeContext>;
    pub async fn get_contextual_docs(&self, context: &CodeContext) -> Vec<DocSuggestion>;
    pub async fn detect_patterns(&self, context: &CodeContext) -> Vec<CodePattern>;
}
```

## Phase 2: Real-time Features (Weeks 3-4)

### Priority: HIGH

**Goal**: Implement real-time code analysis and contextual documentation

### 2.1 File Watcher Integration

- Monitor workspace for file changes
- Trigger analysis on save/modification
- Cache analysis results for performance

### 2.2 LSP Integration

- Connect to language servers for error detection
- Extract semantic information for better context
- Provide real-time diagnostics enhancement

### 2.3 Contextual Documentation API

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct DocSuggestion {
    pub title: String,
    pub relevance: f32,
    pub reason: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub examples: Vec<CodeExample>,
}

pub async fn get_contextual_docs(
    context: &CodeContext,
    error_info: Option<&ErrorInfo>
) -> Result<Vec<DocSuggestion>>;
```

## Phase 3: Learning System (Weeks 5-6)

### Priority: MEDIUM

**Goal**: Implement adaptive learning and skill assessment

### 3.1 Knowledge Assessment Engine

```rust
pub struct AssessmentEngine {
    question_bank: QuestionBank,
    skill_tracker: SkillTracker,
    ollama_client: Arc<EnhancedOllamaClient>,
}

impl AssessmentEngine {
    pub async fn assess_knowledge(&self, topic: &str, user_level: UserLevel) -> Assessment;
    pub async fn generate_questions(&self, gaps: &[SkillGap]) -> Vec<Question>;
    pub async fn evaluate_response(&self, question: &Question, response: &str) -> Evaluation;
}
```

### 3.2 Learning Path Generation

- Dynamic curriculum based on skill gaps
- Time-aware lesson planning
- Progress tracking and adaptation

## Phase 4: Multi-Model Orchestration (Weeks 7-8)

### Priority: MEDIUM

**Goal**: Implement intelligent model selection and response fusion

### 4.1 Model Registry and Selection

```rust
pub struct ModelRegistry {
    models: HashMap<String, ModelCapabilities>,
    performance_metrics: HashMap<String, PerformanceMetrics>,
}

impl ModelRegistry {
    pub fn get_optimal_models(&self, query: &Query) -> Vec<ScoredModel>;
    pub async fn route_query(&self, query: &Query) -> Vec<ModelAssignment>;
    pub fn update_performance(&mut self, model: &str, metrics: &PerformanceMetrics);
}
```

### 4.2 Response Fusion Engine

- Combine multiple model responses intelligently
- Quality scoring and ranking
- Coherent answer synthesis

## Phase 5: Copilot Integration (Weeks 9-10)

### Priority: HIGH

**Goal**: Enhance GitHub Copilot with contextual documentation

### 5.1 VS Code Extension

```typescript
class MCPCopilotExtension {
  private mcpClient: MCPClient;

  async onCompletion(context: CompletionContext): Promise<EnhancedContext> {
    const codeContext = await this.analyzeCurrentContext(context);
    const relevantDocs = await this.mcpClient.getContextualDocs(codeContext);
    return this.enhanceCompletionContext(context, relevantDocs);
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Context Enhancement Pipeline

- Real-time code analysis for Copilot context
- Documentation injection into completion requests
- Pattern recognition for better suggestions

## Phase 6: Proactive Learning (Weeks 11-12)

### Priority: LOW

**Goal**: Implement proactive learning opportunities detection

### 6.1 Session Analysis

```rust
pub struct SessionAnalyzer {
    activity_tracker: ActivityTracker,
    pattern_detector: PatternDetector,
    learning_recommender: LearningRecommender,
}

impl SessionAnalyzer {
    pub async fn analyze_session(&self, session: &CodingSession) -> SessionInsights;
    pub async fn recommend_learning(&self, insights: &SessionInsights) -> Vec<LearningOpportunity>;
}
```

### 6.2 Learning Opportunity Detection

- Error pattern analysis
- Skill gap identification
- Optimal timing detection for learning breaks

## Technical Dependencies
